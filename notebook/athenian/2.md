# Athenians

The **Athenians** are a playable civilization in *0 A.D.* representing the City-State of Athens and its allies during the height of its power. As the forebearers of democracy and philosophy, they are characterized by strong naval power, robust defenses, and a versatile military roster that includes unique champions and mercenaries.

**"We alone regard a man who takes no interest in public affairs, not as a harmless, but as a useless character."**  
— *Pericles' Funeral Oration*

## History
As the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, Athens was famed as a center for the arts, learning, and philosophy. The Athenians were also powerful warriors, particularly at sea. At its peak, Athens dominated a large part of the Hellenic world through the Delian League.

Famous for its silver mines at Laureion and its "Long Walls" connecting the city to its port at Piraeus, Athens was a naval superpower. The city produced legendary figures such as Themistocles, Pericles, and Iphicrates, and was a key player in the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War against Sparta.

## Units

The Athenian military is balanced, with strong infantry and the best navy in the game. They lack Battering Rams and Elephants, relying on catapults for sieges.

### Barracks & Village Units
*   **Hoplite (Hoplites Athenaikos):** Standard citizen-soldier spearman. Strong against cavalry, especially in Phalanx formation.
*   **Slinger (Psilos Athenaios):** Ranged infantry. Athenians are one of the few civilizations to start with Slingers.
*   **Skirmisher (Peltastes Thrax):** Ranged infantry throwing javelins.
*   **Cavalry Skirmisher (Prodromos):** Fast ranged cavalry for raiding.
*   **Melee Cavalry (Hippeus):** Standard citizen cavalry armed with a spear/sword.

### Champion Units
*   **Thracian Black Cloak:** A fast-moving shock infantry unit armed with a sword (Rhomphaia or Xiphos). Available in the Town Phase (Phase 2), making them unique as early champions. Excellent against rams and light troops.
*   **Scythian Archer:** A champion archer unit with high fire rate and armor. Trained at the Gymnaseion.
*   **Epilektos:** (Depending on the alpha version) The elite Athenian Hoplite.
*   **Marine:** Champion swordsman available from high-tier ships or the Dock (after upgrades).

### Siege
*   **Lithobolos (Stone Thrower):** Standard catapult.
*   **Oxybeles (Bolt Shooter):** Anti-unit siege engine.
*   *Weakness:* No Battering Rams.

### Navy
*   **Trireme:** The most powerful standard warship.
*   **Pentekonter:** Scouting and transport ship.
*   **Merchant Ship:** For sea trade.

## Strategy
*   **Naval Dominance:** Use the ship construction bonus to mass a fleet early and control the water on naval maps.
*   **Tortoise:** Utilize strong stone walls (which can be built further out with "Long Walls") and the Theatron to expand territory safely.
*   **Champion Rush:** Uniquely, Athenians can train **Thracian Black Cloaks** in Phase 2, allowing for a powerful infantry push earlier than other civilizations.
*   **Siege Defense:** Since they lack rams, use **Scythian Archers** to snipe enemy siege crews while protecting your own catapults.
