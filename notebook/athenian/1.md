To master the Athenians in 0 A.D. and secure victory, you must lean into their identity as a **naval powerhouse** and a **defensive juggernaut** that excels at the "slow build" and territorial control. The following guide provides a comprehensive breakdown of tips, tricks, and strategies based on the sources.

### **I. Leveraging Civilization Bonuses for Early Advantage**
The Athenians possess unique bonuses that should dictate your early economic and expansion choices:
*   **Naval Speed:** Your ships construct **25% faster**, allowing you to dominate the seas early on water-based maps. This speed is vital for gaining naval superiority before your opponent can react.
*   **The Theatron (Greek Theater):** This specialized building, costing 500 stone and 500 metal, increases your **territory influence by 20%**. It is a Phase 3 building that allows you to capture more resources under your border control. If you capture an enemy Athenian’s Theatron, these bonuses **stack**, further expanding your reach.
*   **Attic Unity (Team Bonus):** In team games, all allies mine metal **10% faster for each age**. By the City Phase (Phase 3), your allies will have a **30% mining speed boost**. Because metal is the most coveted resource for high-level upgrades and champions, an Athenian ally is a massive strategic asset.

### **II. Phase 1: Economic Foundations and Defensive Tricks**
In the Village Phase, your focus is on rapid population growth and resource diversification:
*   **The Slinger Advantage:** Athenian citizen-soldiers include **Slinger Militia**. Unlike javelinists, slingers cost **stone instead of wood**. Use this to your advantage to diversify your resource gathering; by spending stone on units, you can save wood for critical Phase 2 buildings.
*   **The "Sentry Tower" Fast-Age Strategy:** A powerful trick is to build **4–5 Sentry Towers** in Phase 1, as they only cost wood. Once you hit Phase 2, you can upgrade them into **Defense Towers** for 50 wood and 100 stone each. These upgraded towers count as the required buildings to advance to Phase 3, allowing for a **very well-timed and fast City Phase transition** while simultaneously securing your perimeter.
*   **Agricultural Efficiency:** Research the **Loom** early if you expect a rush; it gives female citizens **50% more health**. Additionally, the **Fertility Festival** upgrade at the farmstead allows you to **train women directly from houses**, which is essential for quickly rebuilding your workforce after a raid.
*   **Livestock and Cavalry:** Build a **Corral** to train sheep, which is the **fastest way to gather food** in the game. More importantly, the Corral provides a **10% cavalry speed boost** upgrade. This is critical for maneuvering around the map and catching enemy raiders.

### **III. Military Tactics and Formations**
The Athenian army relies on the **Phalanx** and a mix of high-damage ranged units:
*   **The Phalanx:** All Athenian spear units (Hoplites and City Guard) can use the **Phalanx formation**, which provides a **30% attack bonus and 30% pierce armor bonus** when engaged from the front. This is your primary tool for advancing against enemy archers and slingers.
*   **Mercenary Power (Phase 2):** From the **Stoah**, you can access elite mercenaries a full phase before other civilizations get champions.
    *   **Thracian Black Cloaks:** These swordsmen have **double the damage** of standard citizen-soldiers and significantly higher armor. They also have a **capture attack of 5** (compared to the standard 2), making them elite at seizing enemy buildings.
    *   **Thracian Peltasts:** These are metal-costing javelinists that can be used to bolster your ranks without depleting food or wood.
*   **Phase 3 Champions:**
    *   **City Guard:** Champion spearmen who excel in Phalanx blocks. They have twice the damage of regular hoplites and elite armor.
    *   **Scythian Archers:** These are your only archers on land (unless using the naval upgrade). They have a massive **76-meter range** and a fire rate of two arrows per second, resulting in a **DPS of 13**. Use them to outrange enemy archers, especially when fighting Persians or Mauryans.

### **IV. Hero Strategies: Selecting Your Win Condition**
The hero you choose from the **Council Chamber** will define your playstyle:
*   **Themistocles (The Naval Master):** He is the go-to for water maps. When he is on the field, ship **build time is reduced by 20% and metal cost by 50%**. If he garrisons inside a ship, that ship moves **50% faster** and trains units in batches significantly quicker.
*   **Pericles (The Fortress Builder):** Ideal for defensive "booming" and **Wonder games**. He provides a **15% build and repair rate** for all nearby workers. He also makes **Temples 25% cheaper** and increases the healing rate of units garrisoned within them. Use Pericles to rapidly erect **forward fortresses** or stone walls.
*   **Iphicrates (The Skirmish Commander):** His "Formation Reforms" grant all units in his formation **+15% speed and +3 to ALL armor types** (pierce, hack, and crush). Additionally, all javelin infantry globally receive a **15% speed boost**. This makes your mercenary peltasts and heavy skirmishers incredibly mobile for hit-and-run tactics.

### **V. Siege and Advanced Architecture**
Athenians lack battering rams, which changes how they conduct sieges.
*   **Siege Units:** Use **Bolt Shooters** (Oxybeles) for anti-infantry support and **Siege Catapults** for knocking down buildings. The Bolt Shooter has the longest range of any unit (80m) and can one-shot most low-armor units. Research **"Bolt Accuracy"** at the fortress to increase their DPS by 25%.
*   **The Athenian Long Walls:** This unique technology allows you to build stone walls **outside your territory**. These walls also build **50% faster**. 
    *   *Tip:* Use this to aggressively wall off enemy resources or choke points. To prevent these walls from decaying in neutral territory, you must **garrison units in the wall towers**, which stops the loyalty loss and allows the towers to fire arrows.
*   **Advanced Tower Upgrades:** Always research **"Murder Holes"** to remove the minimum range of your defense towers, preventing enemy units from standing at the base to capture them safely.

### **VI. Economic Management and Late-Game Sustainability**
*   **Citizen-Soldier Ranks:** As your citizen-soldiers rank up through combat, their **gathering rates decrease**. To win the economic war, send your **Elite (Rank 3) veterans** to the front lines and keep **Recruits (Rank 1)** in your fields and forests.
*   **House Management:** Athenian houses have a **garrison limit of six**, but only for **female citizens**. In a raid, use the **Town Alert** to hide women in houses while your men stay out to fight.
*   **Trade Strategy:** In the late game, use the **Marketplace** to barter resources you have in excess. If playing with allies, use **Cartography** early to share map vision and coordinate metal mining near Athenian borders to capitalize on the team bonus.
*   **The Wonder Strategy:** While often frowned upon due to lag in multiplayer, building a Wonder increases your **population cap by 10** (and up to 50 with the "Glorious Expansion" upgrade), bringing your total to **300 units**. It also significantly expands your borders and heals nearby units.

### **VII. Summary of Playstyles for Victory**
1.  **Naval Hegemony:** Use **Themistocles** and the **Iphicratean Reforms** to turn your Triremes into mobile barracks that can train Marines and Cretan archers. Launch amphibious assaults from defended lakes or oceans.
2.  **The Defensive Grind:** Use **Pericles**, **Long Walls**, and **Theatrons** to slowly push your borders forward. Secure metal deposits for your team and win by fielding an unstoppable force of **City Guard in Phalanx formation** supported by **Scythian Archers**.
3.  **The Mercenary Rush:** Leverage your early access to **Thracian Black Cloaks** in Phase 2. A surprise attack with these champion-tier swordsmen can end the game before your opponent reaches Phase 3, provided you have the metal to sustain the cost.



To speed up your early game and optimize resource gathering as the Athenians, you should focus on specific upgrades, unit training techniques, and the strategic diversification of your resources.

### **Speeding Up the Early Game**
*   **Early Economy Kick-start:** Immediately research the **basket upgrade** at the farmstead. This is a one-time, 100-wood investment that increases the foraging rate of fruit and berry bushes by 50%.
*   **The Sentry Tower Fast-Age Trick:** A highly efficient strategy for reaching the City Phase (Phase 3) quickly is to build **four or five Sentry Towers** during the Village Phase (Phase 1) because they only cost wood. Once you reach the Town Phase (Phase 2), upgrade these into **Defense Towers**. These upgraded towers count toward the building requirements needed to advance to Phase 3, allowing you to "boom" into the final age much faster than if you had built slower, more expensive structures like temples or gymnasiums.
*   **Batch Training Efficiency:** Never train units one at a time. Training units in a **batch of five** takes significantly less time (37 seconds) than training five units individually (which would take 50 seconds total). You can further accelerate this at the barracks by researching **conscription**, which increases the speed of batch training even more.
*   **Rapid Workforce Recovery:** If your economy is damaged by a raid, research the **Fertility Festival** at the farmstead. This allows you to **train female citizens directly from your houses**, enabling you to recuperate your workforce across multiple points in your city simultaneously.

### **Key Resources to Gather**
*   **Food (Foraging and Livestock):** In the earliest stages, **foraging** is the most important food source once the basket upgrade is active. For even faster food gathering, build a **Corral** to train sheep or goats. Butchering livestock with citizen cavalry is considered the **fastest way to gather food** in the game.
*   **Stone and Wood Diversification:** To speed up your age-up times, you must manage your wood carefully. Athenians can train **Slinger Militia**, which cost **stone instead of wood**. By focusing on stone gathering early, you can field a ranged defense force without consuming the wood needed for Phase 2 buildings.
*   **Metal Management:** Metal is a "highly coveted" resource required for Phase 2 blacksmith upgrades, champion units, and elite mercenaries. Athenian allies receive a **10% mining boost for metal** for every age that passes, making it strategic to have allies mine near your territory to maximize team resources. 
*   **Resource Upgrades:** Always utilize the **storehouse** to research upgrades for wood, stone, and metal gathering. The fourth storehouse upgrade is particularly useful as it **increases the carry capacity** of your workers, reducing the time they spend walking back and forth to deposit resources.

### **Economic Maintenance Tips**
*   **Rank vs. Work Rate:** Be aware that as citizen-soldiers gain ranks through combat, their **resource gathering rate decreases**. To maintain a fast early game, keep your **Recruits (Rank 1)** assigned to resource gathering and send your **Elite (Rank 3) veterans** to the front lines, as they are worse at working but better at fighting.
*   **Market Bartering:** If you find yourself with an excess of one resource (like food) and a shortage of another (like metal), use the **Marketplace** to barter. You can play the market by selling high-priced resources that your opponents are buying and purchasing cheap ones that they are selling in excess.
