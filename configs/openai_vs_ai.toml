strategy_hint = """
You are playing as Player 1 against the built-in 0 A.D. AI.

Strategy:
1. Economy first: Train 8-10 workers (female citizens)
2. Resource gathering: Focus on food and wood early
3. Build order:
   - Houses for population cap
   - Barracks by minute 4
4. Military: Mix of spearmen and archers
5. Scout early to find enemy base
6. Attack when you have 12-15 military units
7. Keep producing workers while fighting

Remember to use entity IDs from the observation - they change each game!
